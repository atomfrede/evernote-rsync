# Evernote Rsync

A simple java based programm to sync Evernote Attachments
with your local file system.


## Disclaimer

I use this application for my personal purpose on a Unbuntu linux system
and I did not test it on other system.

Use with care and at your own risk.
This programm doesn't write (yet) to Evernote, but may
delete files on your local system if you use the `--delete` option.

I suggest to backup your local working directory, use `--dryRun` option
before every real run and use `--delete` option with care.

However, this programm is developed with best intentions in mind and I hope it's useful.
